= Protean

  http://death.rubyforge.org


== DESCRIPTION

Prototype-based Object-Oriented programming with Ruby.


== FEATURES/ISSUES

* This is a highly expirmental library.
* It is also a very small library.


== RELEASE NOTES

Please see RELEASE file.


== SYNOPSIS

Using Protean you can create objects simple by defining their
attributes via instance variables. Functional attributes
are defined using #fn.

    require 'protean'

    person = prototype do
      @name = ''
      @age = 0
      @announce = fn { |x| "#{x}, #{name} is #{age}." }
    end

    person.name = 'Tom'
    person.age = 35

    person.announce['Peter']  #=> "Peter, Tom is 35."

You can create prototype objects in this manner, then to get
new objects use #new, which effectively clones the prototype.

    another_person = person.new
